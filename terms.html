RL - based Frequency Control for Renewable Energy Microgrids: TERMS
<br> 
</header>

<section>
<h1>
These are the Key Terms:
</h1>

<dl>
<dt>Microgrid</dt>
<dd>A small, localized power grid that can operate independently or with the main grid. It integrates renewable energy sources, storage systems, and loads</dd>
<br>

<dt>Renewable energy sources</dt>
<dd>Energy generated from natural resources like sunlight, wind, and stored energy in batteries, which are sustainable and environmentally friendly.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Droop control</dt>
<dd>A control technique used to share load among generators without communication. It adjusts frequency and voltage based on power output changes.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Active Power (P)</dt>
<dd>The real power that performs actual work, such as running appliances and machinery. It is measured in watts (W).</dd>
<br>

<dt>Reactive Power (Q)</dt>
<dd>Power that supports voltage levels in the system, necessary for magnetic fields in motors and transformers. It is measured in VAR (Volt-Amp Reactive).</dd>
<br>


<dt> Frequency droop</dt>
<dd>Frequency droop is the deviation of frqency from its nominal. A higher load causes a slight frequency drop to balance power.</dd>
<br>


<dt>Frequency Control</dt>
<dd>The process of maintaining the power system frequency within safe limits. It ensures the stability and reliability of the power supply.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Primary Control (Droop Control)</dt>
<dd>The first level of frequency control, responding immediately to changes in load. It adjusts power output based on droop characteristics.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Secondary Control (RL-Based Control)</dt>
<dd>Refines frequency and voltage after primary control adjustments. It uses reinforcement learning for more precise, adaptive control.</dd>
<br>


<dt>Reinforcement learning (RL)</dt>
<dd> A type of machine learning where agents learn optimal actions through rewards and penalties in an environment to achieve goals.</dd>
<br>

<dt>Q-Learning</dt>
<dd>An RL algorithm that helps agents learn the best actions to take in a given state by maximizing cumulative rewards over time.</dd>
<br>

<dt>State, Action, Reward</dt>
<dd>The core components of RL: State represents the environment, Action is the decision made, and Reward is feedback on the action's effectiveness.</dd>
<br>


<dt>Voltage and Current Control</dt>
<dd>Techniques used to regulate voltage and current levels to ensure stable power delivery in microgrids and electrical systems.</dd>
<br>


<dt>RL Controller Inputs and Outputs</dt>
<dd>Inputs include system states like frequency deviation, while outputs are control actions that adjust power system parameters.</dd>
