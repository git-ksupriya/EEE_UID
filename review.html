<td><b>A Review of Droop Control Techniques for Microgrid</b></td>
<td>This paper reviews various droop control techniques used for managing distributed generation (DG) units within a microgrid. 
<br><br>
Droop control is a widely accepted method for load sharing among inverters without requiring communication links. 
<br></td>

<td>Stable Power Sharing – Droop control helps distribute power between different Distributed Generation (DG) sources (like solar, wind, or batteries) without needing communication between them.
<br><br>
Reduced Need for Centralized Control – Since droop control works without requiring communication between generators, it makes the system simpler and more cost-effective to operate.
<br>
</td>
<td>Slow Response Time – Since droop control adjusts power output gradually, it may not respond quickly to sudden load changes, causing temporary instability.
<br><br>
Communication-Free but Less Optimized – While droop control works without requiring communication between generators, it also means there is no coordination, which can lead to inefficient power distribution.</td>

<td><b>Frequency-based control of islanded microgrid with renewable
energy sources and energy storage</b></td>
<td>This paper presents a frequency-based control strategy for an islanded microgrid primarily powered by renewable energy sources (RESs) and an energy storage system (ESS). 
<br><br>
In islanded mode, frequency deviations can degrade power quality, so the study proposes a droop control method where the state of charge (SoC) of the battery determines the microgrid frequency. 
<br><br>
This approach allows all distributed energy resources (DERs) to adjust their power output without direct communication, maintaining power balance. </td>

<td>The proposed control method keeps the microgrid frequency within the strict limits ,ensuring high power quality.
<br><br>
In case of a solid short-circuit, the battery converter injects a large fault current, triggering protection devices to isolate the fault and restore normal operation.
<br></td>
<td>The proposed strategy relies on the battery's ability to handle all power mismatches, which may not be feasible in larger microgrids with high demand fluctuations.
<br><br>
Although the battery aids in short-circuit fault clearance, the study does not extensively explore protection coordination or fault ride-through strategies for severe disturbances.</td>
