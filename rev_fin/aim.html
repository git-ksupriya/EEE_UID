Reinforcement Learning-based Frequency Control for Renewable Energy Microgrids
<br>
</header>
<br>
<p>
This project focuses on maintaining a stable frequency in a renewable energy-based stand-alone microgrid using <b>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>. The RL agent intelligently adjusts the inverterâ€™s modulation index to respond to varying loads and disturbances, thereby regulating frequency in real time.
<br><br>
Our base model in <b>MATLAB Simulink</b> consists of a PV source, a boost converter, a single-phase inverter using a Universal Bridge, and variable resistive loads. The inverter is controlled using PWM signals, where the modulation index is the primary input tuned by the RL agent.
</p>

<h3>Main Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning-Based Frequency Control</li>
  <li>Making a base model to verify the performance</li>
  <li>MATLAB Simulink Model Validation</li>
</ul>

<p>
 DC power from a PV source is stepped up using a boost converter and then converted to AC using a single-phase inverter (Universal Bridge). 
<br>
<b>Dynamic resistive loads</b> are applied to represent real-life load fluctuations.
</p>

<h3>2. Reinforcement Learning-Based Frequency Control:</h3>
<p>
An RL agent is trained to maintain the system's output frequency close to 60 Hz by dynamically adjusting the <b>modulation index</b> of the PWM signal fed to the Universal Bridge inverter.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>State:</b> Includes current frequency deviation </li>
  <li><b>Action:</b> Adjusting the modulation index (value between 0 and 1).</li>
  <li><b>Reward:</b> High reward when frequency stays near 60 Hz; penalized for deviations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The RL controller replaces traditional fixed logic by learning optimal control under variable load conditions.
</p>

<h3>5. MATLAB Simulink Validation:</h3>
<p>
Our simulation model includes:
<ul>
  <li>PV source + Boost Converter (gain + saturation control)</li>
  <li>Single-phase inverter using Universal Bridge</li>
  <li>PWM Generator controlled by modulation index</li>
  <li>LC Filter for output smoothing</li>
  <li>Three dynamic resistive loads</li>
</ul>
<p>
Performance is evaluated by using  scopes to read frequency, camparison with the base model, and RL behavior under disturbances.
</p>

<h3>What is a Microgrid?</h3>
<p>
A localized grid system with renewable sources (like solar PV), local loads, and storage or control systems. It can function with or without the main grid.
</p>

<h3>Problem Addressed:</h3>
<p>
Stand-alone microgrids face frequency instability due to load and source variability. Our model uses RL to learn adaptive control policies in real-time.
</p>

<h3>Project Objective:</h3>
<p>
To stabilize frequency at 60 Hz using a lightweight RL-based controller and validate its efficiency through Simulink modeling and simulation.
