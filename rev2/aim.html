Reinforcement Learning-based Frequency Control for Renewable Energy Microgrids
<br>
</header>
<br>


This project focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to maintain stable frequency in a renewable energy microgrid by adjusting power flow intelligently.

<dl>

<dt>What is a Microgrid:</dt>
<dd>A microgrid is a small power system that includes renewable energy sources (solar, wind), batteries, and loads. It can work independently or with the main power grid.
</dd>
<br>
<dt>Problem:</dt>
<dd>Renewable energy is unpredictable, causing frequency variations that need to be controlled.</dd>
<br>

<dt>What is Reinforcement Learning (RL):</dt>
<dd>RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with the system and improving based on rewards.</dd>

<h3>RL Concepts in our Project:</h3>
<dt>State</dt>
<dd> The current condition of the microgrid, like frequency deviation and active power.</dd>
<dt>Action </dt>
<dd> The control actions taken, such as adjusting battery power or changing generator output based on state</dd>
<dt>Reward </dt> 
<dd>A score given to the RL agent based on how well it maintains a stable frequency.</dd>
<br>
<dt>Goal of the Project:</dt>
<dd>The RL agent learns to take the best actions to keep the microgrid frequency stable, improving efficiency and reducing power fluctuations.
